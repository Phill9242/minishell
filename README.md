### Navigating in the deepwater of a shell


Minishell it's a program that behaves like a shell. This was the most challenge project since the beginning of the course.

To be aproved in this project it's crutial be beyond of basics of shell and understand his behavior, and then mimics him - with a lot of ties imposed with the goal that do not make easy for the students.

The shell display a prompt that have his own builtin functions, PATH, enviroment variables and working history. He can deal with multiple redirects, pipes, exit codes and signals. The parse it's pretty much like the linux shell, and mimic that behaviour was the hardest part of this project. 
To fully understand that order it was necessary hundreds of tests in the Linux Shell; reproduce that behaviour with the ties imposed by the school was a nice and hard challenge.
